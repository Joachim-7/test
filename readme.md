## üéØ Problem Definition-Phase I: Problem Statement
**Title:** Smart Home Energy Management System  
**Objective:**  
Develop an IoT-driven Oracle database solution to monitor, control, and optimize residential energy consumption using PL/SQL.  

**Key Challenges Addressed:**  
- High energy costs due to inefficient appliance usage.  
- Lack of real-time insights into energy patterns.  
- Manual scheduling of home appliances leading to wasted energy.  

---

## üåç Context & Target Users
**Context:**  
- Deployed in residential homes with IoT-enabled devices (e.g., smart thermostats, lights).  
- Integrates with cloud analytics for dynamic pricing adjustments.  

**Target Users:**  
- Homeowners seeking cost savings.  
- Utility companies for load balancing.  
- Environmental advocates promoting sustainable energy use.

## üöÄ Project Goals
1. **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
   - Track live energy usage per appliance via a user portal.  
2. **Automated Controls:**  
   - Adjust HVAC and lighting based on schedules/energy tariffs.  
3. **Data-Driven Insights:**  
   - Generate reports on consumption trends and savings.  
4. **Alerts:**  
   - Notify users of abnormal usage or peak-hour spikes.
